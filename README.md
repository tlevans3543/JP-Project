# JP-Project

Create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line.

This structure would then allow easy modification to handle different
products: i.e multimedia devices which include music and movie players.
Design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production
line items. For this particular production facility you will only
implement a concrete class for music and movie players.
